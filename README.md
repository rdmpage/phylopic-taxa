# PhyloPic taxa

Exemplar images for higher taxa from [PhyloPic](http://phylopic.org). For a higher taxon name we fetch an image (SG and/or PNG) and store the image by taxon name in a folder. We also store the API response as a JSON file that includes license and creator information for the images. Images are stored in subfolders labelled with the first letter of the taxon name.
