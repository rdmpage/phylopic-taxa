# PhyloPic taxa

Exemplar images for higher taxa from [PhyloPic](http://phylopic.org). For a higher taxon name we fetch an image (SVG and/or PNG) and store the image by taxon name in a folder. We also store the API response as a JSON file that includes license and creator information for the images so that these can be easily retrieved. Images are stored in subfolders labelled with the first letter of the taxon name. Goal is to provide trivial lookup of images for taxa.
